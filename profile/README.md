# Team CivMappers
## Mission:
Our goal is to assess the habitability of a given area. This is determined by analyzing an image for the presence of trees/vegetation, mountains/topography, and water, alongside measurements of temperature, humidity, air pressure, and the direction of the magnetic field (north pole).
## Motivation:
We were inspired by various games where players build settlements or civilizations and extract resources from the surrounding environment, such as the Civilization series or Catan. These principles have fascinated us for years, and we are eager to implement an automated system for identifying optimal settlement locations.
